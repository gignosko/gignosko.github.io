It's the end of the first day of PyTN and I've had a great time so far. Even better, I'm a lot less nervous about my first time presenting. I've seen some great presentations and I'm looking forward to more tomorrow, and the woman that presented essentially the same material I am did a great job. I was really worried that her presentation would completely put mine to shame, especially because she's a data scientist and I'm just a guy playing with data. As it turned out, her talk was about the same level as mine and even though she went over many of the same libraries, she handled it in a different way than I will, so anyone who went to hers should still get something out of mine.

Here's the github to my talk for anyone that stumbles across this blog.
