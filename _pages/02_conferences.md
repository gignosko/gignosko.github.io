I love going to conferences, it's such a great way to meet new people and be introduced to new ideas. 

My favorite part of going to a conference is presenting, thouogh. I really love being able to give new ideas to people and then have that lead to great discussions. I'm always amazed at how many people come up to me after a talk and want to ask questions of tell me what they're doing that relates. Every talk I've given has been a great experience for me.
