<p>I work with one of the organizers of PyTennessee and a few weeks ago he held a lunch-n-learn to encourage some of us to submit talks. That was on a Wednesday, the deadline was Saturday at midnight. Plenty of time! So, I summoned all of my college and grad-school paper writing mojo and started proposing…on Friday night. I probably wasn’t the last proposal, but I probably wasn’t far off.</p>

<p>So, today he taps me on the shoulder, gives me a fist bump and says “Congratulations.” I honestly had no idea what he was talking about. I had no expectations that this proposal that I put together almost entirely for the rejection feedback (hoping it would help me craft a better proposal when I was really more prepared) would get accepted.  I could see the glaring holes and the half churned ideas, but that’s always been the case with my work; luckily, I’m usually harder on myself than my teachers and now the proposal committee. As it turns out, they like me, they really like me!</p>

<p>And so it is that I have 2 months to finish up a talk on the tools of data science in python. I actually have it all mapped out in my head, I just need to get it all on paper, in the form of an iPython notebook. I hope this is a good way to start (and keep) that programming blog I’ve been hoping to write for the last few years.</p>
